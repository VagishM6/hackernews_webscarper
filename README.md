# hackernews_webscarper
This script can extract news from the hackernews web page sorted out by the votes and title of the news.

Instead of accessing data through the traditional API json endpoits, i have used BeautifulSoup library to access the html elements to get the data and display the newses and votes using a dictionary data structure.

### libraries
1. BeautifulSoup
> pip install beautifulsoup4
